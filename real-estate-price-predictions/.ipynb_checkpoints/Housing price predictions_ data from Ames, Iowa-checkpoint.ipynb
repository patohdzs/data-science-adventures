Read in training data and use it to define target variable vector `train_y` and feature matrix `train_X`.\n2. Instantiate and train a Random Forest model using data in `train_y` and `train_X`.\n3. Read in the test data, which doesn't include values for the target variable, and define the testing features matrix `test_X`, using the same features as in `train_X`.\n4. Predict house prices using data in `test_X` and Random Forest model. Store test predictions vector in `test_pred_y`.\n5. Format test predictions into a .csv file for submission.\n6. Submit predictions to the competition.\n**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data retrieval, exploration and cleaning"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing libraries and modules\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\n# Setting up code checking\nimport os\nif not os.path.exists(\"../input/train.csv\"):\n    os.symlink(\"../input/home-data-for-ml-course/train.csv\", \"../input/train.csv\")  \n    os.symlink(\"../input/home-data-for-ml-course/test.csv\", \"../input/test.csv\") \nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.machine_learning.ex7 import *\n\n# Path of the file to read.

Begin by clicking on the blue **Save Version** button in the top right corner of this window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the blue **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\nIf you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.\n\n\n# Continuing Your Progress\nThere are many ways to improve your model, and **experimenting is a great way to learn at this point.**\n\nThe best way to improve your model is to add features.  Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.  Some features will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n**[Introduction to Machine Learning Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
